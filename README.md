# Self-Balancing-Robot
This project involves designing a 2-wheeled, self-balancing robot with capabilities for sensor integration. Using 3-axis accelerometers, gyros, and odometry, the robot maintains an upright position while allowing for IR remote-controlled movement.

Key Components

3D-Printed Robot Frame: Forms the robot's structural base.

Robot Wheels (2): Enable robot mobility.

Training Stand: Assists in testing and development.

Buna-N Nitrile O-Rings (2): Serve as mechanical buffers.

DC Gearhead Motors (2): Power the wheels.

Pan Head Screws (4): For component assembly.

DRV8833 Dual H-Bridge: Manages motor control.

MPU-6050 6-DOF IMU: Balancing and orientation data.

Optical Interrupters (2): Measure wheel rotation for odometry.

IR Sensor: Receives remote control signals.

Resistors (4): Limit current and provide pull-up for sensors.

Battery Holder: Contains batteries for power.

Development and Learning
This project demonstrates intricate hardware-software integration, offering a hands-on experience in robotic controls, sensor interfacing, and real-time system programming.
